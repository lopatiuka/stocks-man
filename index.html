                            <p class = "about-intro">Jeff Bezos, aka the richest man in the world, created Amazon, one of the largest
                                technology companies in the world. Bezos drew up the Amazon business plan on a road trip from New York to 
                                Seattle. In 1993, he left his job at D.E. Shaw to start Amazon from his garage. He received an estimated 
                                $300,000 to invest in Amazon from his parents. He originally titled the company Cadabra, but changed it to 
                                name it after the Amazon River.

                                    <p class = "history-paragraph">Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookstore, but always planned to expand to other products. 
                                        In 1998, the site expanded to offer music, videos, and other consumer goods. In 2002, Bezos led the 
                                        company to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic. 
                                        The company nearly went bankrupt in 2002, but it rebounded in 2003 after distribution center closures 
                                        and workforce layoffs. Later Amazon launched the Kindle in November 2007.

                                        as soon as the same day. Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017, furthering its 
                                        reach in the grocery industry.
                                        Amazon is currently traded at around 3200 USD per share, while only in the year of 2020, Amazon has
