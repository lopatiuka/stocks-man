                            <p class = "about-intro">Jeff Bezos, aka the richest man in the world, created Amazon, one of the largest 
                                technology companies in the world. Bezos drew up the Amazon business plan on a road trip from New York 
                                to Seattle. In 1993, he left his job at D.E. Shaw to start Amazon from his garage. He received an 
                                estimated $300,000 to invest in Amazon from his parents. He originally titled the company Cadabra, 
                                but soon changed it in tribute to the Amazon River.

                                    <p class = "history-paragraph">Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookstore, but always planned to 
                                        expand to other products. In 1998, the site expanded to offer music, videos, and other consumer 
                                        goods. In 2002, Bezos led the company to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from 
                                        weather channels and website traffic. The company nearly went bankrupt in 2002, but it 
                                        rebounded in 2003 after distribution center closures and workforce layoffs. Later Amazon 
                                        launched the Kindle in November 2007.

                                        groceries online and have them delivered the same day. Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 
                                        billion in August 2017, furthering its reach in the grocery industry. Amazon is currently 
                                        traded at around 3200 USD per share, while only in the year of 2020, Amazon has shown a growth 
                                        from 1875 USD to 3200 USD, which translates to 170% Growth in less than a year… Talk about a

                                    <p>This is a subjective question. Earning from stocks can relate to both your entry time and

                                        share to over 3000 USD. That was a yearly growth of over 77% which was the potential profit

                                    takes about 5 minutes. But having said that, there is always more than just making a registration,
